In the resources menu in figma > Plugins>Install figma plugin "Figma to HTML"
This allows you to generate the css and html for the elements and export to file
We will use figma to model and generate the design and then whatever the 
values are and we will be converting those to vh(viewhight) and vw(viewwidth) in order
to get the website to be responsive so when you shrink it it will scale acordingly. 
Figma to HTML does everything in PX which needs to be converted to vh vw and em
Also it generates generic class names and mostly divs so we have to rename everything to the semantic meaning 
of html tags 
For example it is generating class (a123) for a button, we have the change that to for example (main_button)

also when you are coding something use the dev branch instead of main branch
Always do a git pull before starting to work on something so you get the new version
or you will have issues with the versions
